Task 0:
Time complexity is O(1) since the same amount of operations will occur regardless to the size of the data


Task 1:
Time complexity is O(n) as the number of operations will increase proportionately to the data size


Task 2:
Time complexity is O(n) as the number of operations will increase proportionately to the data size


Task 3:
The first portion of the problem getting the area codes that were called by Bangalore numbers is O(n)
The second is de-duping the list by creating a set is O(n)
The last part using the sorted function to print the set in order is O(n log n) according to the documentation
plus the loop to print them O(n)

So this is worst case. Considering if all phone calls made are from Bangalore and all of the numbers called were from
different area codes.
O(n log n + 3n) in this Task


Task 4:
So in this task I have to differentiate the inputs so let's sey calls have a count of n and texts have a count of m
Theres O(2n) iterating through calls twice
Theres O(m) iterating through texts
Theres O(n log n) sorting the possible_telemarketers
And O(n) to print the numbers

This is the worst case where calls are telemarketers and each number is unique
O(n log n + 3n + m)
